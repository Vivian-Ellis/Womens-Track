# Womens-Track
I will be examining the women’s track dataset, this includes the 100, 200, 400, 800, 1500, 3000-meter dash and the marathon time completion as well as the associated country. The women’s track dataset has 55 observations. Factor analysis will help to understand if these attributes could be grouped and possibly reduced. In particular, I will use exploratory factor analysis thus there will be no hypothesis since I do not know how the factors behave. First, I will be examining the simple statistics and correlation matrix for the 7 metric variables: 100, 200, 400, 800, 1500, 3000-meter dash and the marathon time completion.
